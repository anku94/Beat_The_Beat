This project was done as a part of the 5 day MIT Media Labs Design and Innovation workshop, PESIT 2013.

It aims at creating an intelligent music player that studies the dancing patterns of the user and manipulates the music accordingly.

If the user dances fast(slow), the song plays at a faster(slower) speed. If the dancing speed is even faster(slower), the application switches to different track altogether which is faster(slower) than the existing one.

This can help in eliminating the need for a DJ and can prove to be a fun and healthy exercise.

We have used Microsoft Kinect with Synapse API to track the motion of the user. The rest of the part is done in OpenFrameworks in Microsoft Visual C++ IDE.

You can refer to the POSTER.jpg for a quick understanding of the project idea.

Note:
Make sure to add some songs renamed as 'song1', 'song2' etc. in the "bin/data/" folder.
